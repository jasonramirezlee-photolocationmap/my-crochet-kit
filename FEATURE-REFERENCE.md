# 🎯 FEATURE REFERENCE - Pain Points We're Solving

Based on extensive research of crochet communities (Reddit, Facebook, app reviews), here are the TOP pain points we MUST solve to destroy the competition!

## 🔥 CRITICAL PAIN POINTS (Must-Have Features)

### 1. Pattern Organization is TERRIBLE in Other Apps
**The Problem:**

- Can't search by name
- Patterns disappear when switching apps
- No way to tag or categorize

**Our Solution:**
- Smart search by name, project type, yarn weight

### 2. Pattern Reading Feels Like "A Foreign Language"
**The Problem:**
- US vs UK terms confusion
- Complex abbreviations
- Hard to keep your place
- Patterns close and you lose your spot

**Our Solution:**
- Built-in US/UK term converter

- Auto-save your place in every pattern

---

### 3. Row Counters That Actually WORK
**The Problem:**
- Counters reset randomly (data loss!)

**Our Solution:**
