# 🎉 START HERE! Your My Crochet Kit App is Ready!

## 👋 WELCOME!

Congratulations! I just built the **foundation** of your "My Crochet Kit" PWA! Let me explain what you have and what to do next.

## 📦 WHAT I BUILT FOR YOU:

### ✅ A Beautiful, Working Website
- **Home Page**: Landing page with pricing tiers (First Stitch, Hooked, Master Maker)
- **App Dashboard**: Where users will use the crochet tools
- **Mobile-Friendly**: Works perfectly on phones, tablets, and computers
- **Offline-First**: Works without internet! (That's what PWA means)
- **Installable**: Users can add it to their phone home screen like a real app

### ✅ Your Color Palette (Yarn-Inspired! 🧶)
- Cream backgrounds (like natural wool)
- Dusty Rose buttons (warm and inviting)
- Sage Green accents (calming)
- Lavender touches (soft and pretty)
- Warm Browns for text (like wooden crochet hooks!)

### ✅ Professional Tech Stack
- **Next.js 14** - The latest and greatest web framework
- **TypeScript** - Helps prevent bugs before they happen
- **Tailwind CSS** - Makes everything look beautiful
- **PWA Ready** - Works offline, installable, fast!
