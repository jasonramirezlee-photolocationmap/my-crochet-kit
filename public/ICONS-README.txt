# App Icons - TODO


You'll need to create two icon files for your PWA:

## Required Icons:
1. **icon-192x192.png** - 192x192 pixels
2. **icon-512x512.png** - 512x512 pixels

## How to Create Them:

### Option 1: Use a Free Tool
- Go to https://favicon.io/
- Or use https://realfavicongenerator.net/
- Upload a simple image (like a yarn ball emoji 🧶 or crochet hook)
- Download the generated icons

### Option 2: Use Canva (Free)
- Go to canva.com
- Create a new 512x512px design
- Add a yarn ball, crochet hook, or text "MCK"
- Use your color palette (rose: #D4A5A5, cream: #FFF8F0)
- Export as PNG
- Resize to 192x192 for the smaller version

### Where to Put Them:
Place both files in: `/public/`

So your files will be:
- `/public/icon-192x192.png`
- `/public/icon-512x512.png`

## For Now (Quick Fix):
You can temporarily use emoji as icons! The app will work fine without proper icons, they just won't look as polished when installed.

Most important: Get the app working first, make icons pretty later! 🎨
